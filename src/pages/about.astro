        I’m from Mallorca, Spain. I started programming about five years ago,
        building small projects and experimenting on my own. That eventually led
        me to study a two-year Web Development degree at

      <p>
        Along the way I discovered the world of Web3 and got hooked. For the
        last couple of years I’ve been focusing on blockchain development:
        learning how smart contracts work, how to design protocols and how to
        ship real dApps end-to-end. These days, most of my coding time goes into
        building applications for the Web3 space and improving my skills around
        smart contracts and tooling.

        I enjoy working on problems where I can mix on-chain logic with
        real-world use cases, write clear and maintainable code and back it up
        with good tests. I care about understanding how things work under the
        hood and I like to keep learning new tools, patterns and ideas from the
        ecosystem.

      <p class="pt-2 text-sm lg:text-base text-slate-400">
        I’m currently looking for opportunities as a blockchain / smart contract
        developer where I can contribute, keep learning from experienced people
        and help build useful products in the space.
